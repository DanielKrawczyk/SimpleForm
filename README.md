This is a very simple website with some inputs. You can make a new dish with time preparation, type of a dish and some additional info about it. I used React library with Redux. Styles are mostly using the Bootstrap framework and some CSS rules. Simple and clear as code is. The full code of the website is available in the “Code” folder. Everything is set up and ready to use.

The API response is visible as a console.log.
